Welcome to My TCP Chat application.

To start this you must run server first by typing into the command prompt "python3 server.py"

This will initialize the server and report a port number, portNumber, for clients to connect to. You will need this to start the chat client.

To start the chat client, type in the command prompt "python3 client.py username chat://localhost:portNumber", where username is the username you wish to be idenified by 
and portNumber is the port number that the server reports that it is listening on. 

For example, is the server reports it is listening on port 12345 and my username is Bob, I would start the client as follows:

python3 client.py bob chat://localhost:12345

Commands:
!exit - exits the current terminal. Only works for clients
!follow <term> - follows the term or user specified. To follow a user, must be prefaced by @. For example, @user
!unfollow <term> - unfollows the specified term
!list - lists the current users in the server 
!attach <filename> <terms> - Uploads a file to the server with specified filename. It gets sent to anyone that follows a term in <terms>. For example, if 
user bob follows the term apple, and the command typed is !attach file.txt apple, the file will get sent to anyone following the term apple. In this case, it would be bob.

Messages are only sent to users that:

- Follow the user who sent the message
    Ex: If user bob follows user Jon, and Jon sends the message "Hi!", bob would receieve that message.
- Follow a term within the message
    Ex: If user bob sends a message containing the term "apple" and user jon follows the term "apple", then jon would receieve the message
- Receieve an @ in the message
    Ex: IF user bob sends the message "Hi @jon". Jon would receieve the message.
Users will only receieve a message once. This means that if the user is following mutiple terms within a message or if the user is following a term and receieves an @ in the message, they will not receieve mutiple instances of the same message for each followed term/@. 

Special Cases: 
- Messages sent with the @all tag will get sent to all users except the user who sent it.
