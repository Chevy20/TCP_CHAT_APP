Welcome to My TCP Chat application.

To start this you must run server first by typing into the command prompt "python3 server.py"

This will initialize the server and report a port number, portNumber, for clients to connect to. You will need this to start the chat client.

To start the chat client, type in the command prompt "python3 client.py username chat://localhost:portNumber", where username is the username you wish to be idenified by 
and portNumber is the port number that the server reports that it is listening on. 

For example, is the server reports it is listening on port 12345 and my username is Bob, I would start the client as follows:

python3 client.py bob chat://localhost:12345
