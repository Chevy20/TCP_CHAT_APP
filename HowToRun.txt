Welcome to My TCP Chat application.

To start this you must run server first by typing into the command prompt "python3 server.py"

This will initialize the server and report a port number, portNumber, for clients to connect to. You will need this to start the chat client.

To start the chat client, type in the command prompt "python3 client.py username chat://localhost:portNumber", where username is the username you wish to be idenified by 
and portNumber is the port number that the server reports that it is listening on. 

For example, is the server reports it is listening on port 12345 and my username is Bob, I would start the client as follows:

python3 client.py bob chat://localhost:12345

Commands:
!exit - exits the current terminal. Only works for clients
!follow <term> - follows the term or user specified. To follow a user, must be prefaced by @. For example, @user
!unfollow <term> - unfollows the specified term
!list - lists the current users in the server 
!attach <filename> <terms> - Uploads a file to the server with specified filename. It gets sent to anyone that follows a term in <terms>. For example, if 
user bob follows the term apple, and the command typed is !attach file.txt apple, the file will get sent to anyone following the term apple. In this case, it would be bob.
